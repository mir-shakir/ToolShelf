I hadn't written it. I hadn't even been awake when it published. This wasn't a hack. This was my automation doing exactly what I programmed it to do. And that's when I realized: I might have taken this too far.</p><p>For the past 6 months, I've been running an experiment. How much of technical blogging can actually be automated with AI? Not just "AI helps me write faster" - I mean full automation. From research to publishing, with GitHub PRs, code review agents, and auto-generated images.</p><p>I built five different versions of this system. Some worked. Some spectacularly didn't. And what I learned surprised me more than the automation itself.</p><img src="https://dszufhozbgwxgoanxljq.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/generations/2a6977e2-cb1b-4027-ab46-b33c5c0a7ddc/66b77f85-83b1-456c-b46b-803efa5f6570.png" alt="An illustration of a developer working alongside an AI robot at a desk, symbolizing a hybrid content creation workflow." style="width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:20px 0;"><figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-bottom: 20px;">Figure 1: The Human-AI collaboration that actually works.</figcaption><h2 id="why-i-built-this">Why I Built This</h2><p>I'm a backend developer who built ToolShelf - a collection of developer tools. I knew I needed content for SEO. I knew consistent blogging would help. And I absolutely knew I didn't want to spend hours every week writing blog posts.</p><p>The math was simple:</p><ul><li>Good technical post: 4-6 hours</li><li>Needed frequency: 2 posts per week</li><li>That's 10+ hours weekly on content</li><li>Plus my full-time job</li></ul><p>So I did what any developer would do: I <a href="https://toolshelf.tech/blog/n8n-developer-workflow-automation-2025/">automated it</a>.</p><h2 id="version-1-the-let-ai-do-everything-disaster">Version 1: The "Let AI Do Everything" Disaster</h2><p>The first version was ambitious. Maybe too ambitious.</p><h3 id="the-workflow-v1">The Workflow</h3><p>AI agent → picks trending topics → researches → writes draft → formats → creates GitHub PR → another AI reviews it → auto-merges → publishes daily. I thought I was brilliant. I'd solved content creation.</p><h3 id="the-reality-v1">The Reality</h3><p>It lasted three weeks. The AI picked topics nobody cared about. The research was... creative. And by "creative" I mean it made things up with absolute confidence. Citations that didn't exist. Statistics from nowhere.</p><p>The breaking point? A post went live claiming something technically wrong about databases. Not subtly wrong - completely wrong. Someone pointed it out in the comments. I had to publish a correction. That put me in doubt and I had to review each and every post thoroughly. Read about more <a href="https://toolshelf.tech/blog/database-migrations-disasters/">database disaster stories here</a>.</p><p><strong>Lesson 1:</strong> AI with no human oversight is just confident nonsense at scale.</p><h2 id="version-2-i-pick-topics-ai-writes">Version 2: I Pick Topics, AI Writes</h2><p>Okay, new approach. I choose topics I know are relevant. AI handles the writing.</p><h3 id="the-workflow-v2">The Workflow</h3><p>Web form → I submit topic → AI researches → generates outline → writes full post → creates PR → <strong>I review manually</strong> → publish. This worked better. Much better.</p><p>Topics were actually useful. The writing wasn't half bad. But I was still catching mistakes. Lots of them. Code examples that looked right but weren't. Explanations that were technically accurate but misleading. The kind of stuff you only catch if you actually know the domain.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2:</strong> AI is really good at sounding right. Not always at being right.</p><h2 id="version-3-the-system-that-actually-works">Version 3: The System That Actually Works</h2><p>Six months in, this is what I use now.</p><h3 id="the-workflow-v3">The Workflow</h3><ol><li>I write a rough draft (30-45 minutes, brain dump)</li><li>Submit via form with topic + my draft</li><li>AI agent takes over:<ul><li>Structures it into proper HTML</li><li>Adds correct meta tags for SEO</li><li>Formats code blocks with syntax highlighting</li><li>Generates blog header image (via my LayoutCraft API)</li><li>Creates all the boring structural stuff</li></ul></li><li>Creates GitHub PR</li><li><strong>AI structural review</strong> (checks file structure, meta tags, not content)</li><li><strong>I review the actual content</strong></li><li>Merge = auto-publish</li></ol><p>This is the sweet spot. AI became my assistant, not my replacement.</p><h3 id="the-tech-stack">The Tech Stack (For the Curious)</h3><ul><li><strong>Automation:</strong> <a href="https://toolshelf.tech/blog/n8n-developer-workflow-automation-2025/">n8n</a> (self-hosted on Google Cloud free tier). Five different workflow variations for different scenarios. Total hosting cost: $0/month.</li><li><strong>AI Layer:</strong> Gemini 2.5 Pro for content structuring, Claude for anything requiring technical precision. Total AI costs over 6 months: ~$50. Learn more about <a href="https://toolshelf.tech/blog/why-your-llm-api-costs-are-through-the-roof/">managing LLM API costs</a>.</li><li><strong>Publishing:</strong> GitHub for version control (every post is a PR) and Render for hosting. This matters: bad post goes live? Revert the PR. Site redeploys. Post gone. Takes 30 seconds.</li><li><strong>Images:</strong> I built LayoutCraft specifically for this problem. AI image generators gave me weird, inconsistent results. LayoutCraft: consistent style, professional, no artifacts. Every header takes 3 seconds to generate.</li></ul><h2 id="what-actually-happened">What Actually Happened</h2><p>I'm not going to pretend I have precise metrics for everything. I don't track every view and comment obsessively. But here's what I noticed:</p><ul><li><strong>The posts that performed well:</strong> Started with my ideas, my examples, my experience. AI structured them.</li><li><strong>The posts that fell flat:</strong> Too much AI, not enough me. You can feel it when you read them.</li><li><strong>Comments:</strong> People engage more with posts that sound like a real person had real problems and solved them.</li><li><strong>The best performing stuff:</strong> When I wrote about things I actually did, with real code I actually ran, showing real mistakes I actually made. AI can't invent that.</li></ul><h2 id="when-things-broke">When Things Broke</h2><h3 id="the-infinite-loop-incident">The Infinite Loop Incident</h3><p>Early version had a bug. Workflow published a post. That triggered a "new post" webhook. Which triggered the workflow again. Which published another post. Which triggered... Woke up to 12 draft PRs. Luckily the Gemini API hit the rate limits which stopped the workflow.</p><h3 id="the-it-compiled-it-ran-its-completely-insecure-problem">The "It Compiled, It Ran, It's Completely Insecure" Problem</h3><p>AI wrote a code example. JavaScript, JWT validation. It compiled. It ran. It demonstrated the concept. It was also wildly insecure. A reader gently pointed this out via email. For a deep dive on how to do it right, check out our <a href="https://toolshelf.tech/blog/jwt-explained-ultimate-guide-api-authentication/">ultimate guide to JWTs</a>.</p><p>Now I review every code example. Every. Single. One.</p><h3 id="the-revert-marathon">The Revert Marathon</h3><p>Over 6 months, I reverted 7 posts after publishing. Why?</p><ul><li>Technical inaccuracy I missed in review (3 times)</li><li>Code example that doesn't work in real scenarios (2 times)</li><li>Post just... felt wrong after seeing it live (2 times)</li></ul><p>The GitHub PR system saved me. Each revert took under a minute.</p><h3 id="the-ai-review-agent-reality-check">The AI Review Agent Reality Check</h3><p>I built an AI agent to review posts before publishing. It checked structure, file organization, meta tags - technical stuff. Here's what I learned: AI reviewing AI structure works great. AI reviewing AI content? Pointless. They make the same mistakes. They miss the same errors. It's a bit like the problem of <a href="https://toolshelf.tech/blog/ai-security-crisis-prompt-injection-surge-guide/">prompt injection</a>; the system can't easily spot its own kind of flaws.</p><p>So now: AI checks the structure (did we include all files? are meta tags present?). I check the content (is this actually correct?).</p><h2 id="what-ai-actually-does-well">What AI Actually Does Well</h2><p>After half a year of this, here's what I trust AI with:</p><ul><li><strong>Structure and Format:</strong> HTML hierarchy, semantic markup, responsive images, code block formatting, table of contents generation.</li><li><strong>SEO Metadata:</strong> Title tags, meta descriptions, OG tags for social sharing, URL slug generation.</li><li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Same formatting every time, proper heading levels, consistent code style, internal linking to related posts.</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> Draft to structured post: 10 minutes. No writer's block. No staring at blank screens.</li></ul><h2 id="what-ai-cant-do">What AI Can't Do</h2><h3 id="voice-and-personality">Voice and Personality</h3><p>AI sounds like... AI. It's professionally bland. It uses the same transitions. The same phrases. You can feel it. The posts that get shared? They sound like a real person.</p><h3 id="real-experience">Real Experience</h3><p>"I tried this approach and here's what broke" - AI can't write that. It hasn't tried anything. It hasn't debugged at 2am. It hasn't dealt with production fires. Readers can tell the difference. This human element is precisely <a href="https://toolshelf.tech/blog/why-ai-cant-design/">why AI can't truly design</a> or create from experience.</p><h3 id="strategic-thinking">Strategic Thinking</h3><p>What should I write about? What's actually useful? What gap exists in the content out there? AI has no clue. It can research what exists. It can't tell you what's missing.</p><h3 id="judgment-calls">Judgment Calls</h3><p>When to use a complex example vs. a simple one. When to go deep vs. stay high-level. What caveats actually matter in practice. These require understanding the reader, the context, the real-world implications. AI doesn't have that. It just assumes.</p><h2 id="the-uncomfortable-truth">The Uncomfortable Truth</h2><p>Here's what I tell people: <strong>AI-written content is usually good enough.</strong> "Good enough" gets traffic. "Good enough" ranks in search. "Good enough" fills your editorial calendar. But here's the thing: the posts that build real audience? The ones people remember? The ones that get referenced months later? Those need human experience. Real problems. Real solutions. Real voice.</p><p>AI is fast food for content. It fills you up. It's consistent. It's cheap. But you won't remember the meal tomorrow.</p><h2 id="would-i-recommend-this">Would I Recommend This?</h2><h3 id="build-this-if">Build this if:</h3><ul><li>You know your domain deeply (can catch AI mistakes)</li><li>You're willing to review everything</li><li>You need consistent output</li><li>You have technical skills for the automation</li><li>You're okay with "good enough" most of the time</li></ul><h3 id="dont-build-this-if">Don't build this if:</h3><ul><li>You're building a personal brand (your voice matters more)</li><li>You don't have time to review (dangerous)</li><li>You're writing in unfamiliar territory</li><li>You want exceptional content, not just acceptable</li></ul><h2 id="what-im-doing-now">What I'm Doing Now</h2><p>Six months in, here's my approach:</p><ul><li><strong>For ToolShelf blog:</strong> I write rough drafts (my ideas, my experience), AI structures and formats, I review and adjust. Total time: ~1 hour per post vs. 4-6 hours before.</li><li><strong>For anything important:</strong> Portfolio pieces, personal brand content, I write it myself.</li></ul><p>The hybrid works.</p><h2 id="the-real-lesson">The Real Lesson</h2><p>I didn't learn that AI can replace writing. I learned that AI can replace the parts of writing I don't want to do anyway. The thinking? That's mine. The structure? That's AI. The experience? That's mine. The formatting? That's AI.</p><p>I'm not writing less. I'm writing better drafts and letting automation handle the boring parts. And here's the weird part: I think I'm a better writer now than 6 months ago. Not because of AI. Because I'm focusing on the parts that actually matter: ideas, clarity, usefulness. AI handles the rest.</p><p>The system is still running. The automation I built isn't going away. It saves time. It's consistent. It works. But I've accepted something important: I'm not trying to eliminate myself from the process. I'm trying to eliminate the tedious parts so I can focus on what actually requires a human. The best content still needs me. The ideas, the war stories, the judgment calls - that's irreplaceable.</p><p>AI is my co-pilot. Not my replacement. And honestly? That's exactly what I wanted it to be.</p></div><div class="blog-post-navigation"><a href="#" id="prevPostLink" class="nav-link-post prev-post hidden"><i class="fas fa-arrow-left"></i><span>Previous Post</span><span class="nav-post-title"></span></a><a href="#" id="nextPostLink" class="nav-link-post next-post hidden"><span>Next Post</span><span class="nav-post-title"></span><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></a></div><section class="related-posts-section"><h2 class="section-title">Also Read</h2><div class="related-posts-grid"><!-- Related posts will be injected here by JavaScript --></div></section></article></div></main><footer class="app-footer"><div class="footer-content"><div class="footer-main"><div class="footer-logo"><div class="logo-icon"><i class="fas fa-toolbox"></i></div><strong>ToolShelf</strong></div><p class="footer-description">Professional online tools that respect your privacy.
