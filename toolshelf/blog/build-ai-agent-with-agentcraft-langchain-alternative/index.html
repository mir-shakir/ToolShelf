From managing your calendar to conducting complex market research, the potential is immense. But as a developer, how do you move from concept to code and actually build one?</p><p>While powerful frameworks like LangChain have pioneered this space, they can present a steep learning curve. Developers often find themselves wrestling with complex abstractions, deep inheritance chains, and significant boilerplate just to get a simple agent running. This complexity can stifle innovation and slow down the rapid prototyping that is crucial in the fast-moving AI landscape.</p><p>Enter AgentCraft. AgentCraft is a new, developer-friendly Python framework designed from the ground up for simplicity, speed, and modularity. It strips away the unnecessary complexity, offering an intuitive API that lets you focus on your agent's logic, not on the framework's intricacies.</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, we will provide a clear, step-by-step tutorial to build your first functional AI agent—a research assistant that can browse the web and summarize its findings. By the end, you'll not only have a working agent but also a deep understanding of why AgentCraft is a compelling, modern choice for your next AI project.</p><h2 id="what-is-agentcraft-and-why-choose-it-over-langchain">What is AgentCraft and Why Choose It Over LangChain?</h2><h3 id="a-quick-introduction-to-agentcrafts-philosophy">A Quick Introduction to AgentCraft's Philosophy</h3><p>AgentCraft's core mission is to democratize and simplify the creation of sophisticated AI agents. It operates on the principle that building powerful AI should be an intuitive and enjoyable experience for developers, not a battle with framework abstractions.</p><p>Key features that embody this philosophy include:</p><ul><li><strong>Intuitive, Functional API:</strong> AgentCraft favors simple function calls and clear class initializations over complex chains and expression languages. You define what you want your agent to do in plain Python.</li><li><strong>Minimal Boilerplate:</strong> Get from an idea to a running agent in fewer lines of code. The framework handles the complex prompt engineering and tool-calling logic behind the scenes, presenting a clean interface to the developer.</li><li><strong>Curated, Built-in Tool Library:</strong> AgentCraft comes with a set of well-maintained and ready-to-use tools for common tasks like web search, file I/O, and code execution, allowing for rapid development.</li><li><strong>Easy Debugging and Observability:</strong> With a simpler call stack and transparent execution flow, pinpointing issues in your agent's reasoning process is straightforward. AgentCraft is designed with logging and tracing in mind.</li></ul><h3 id="agentcraft-vs-langchain-a-developers-perspective">AgentCraft vs. LangChain: A Developer's Perspective</h3><p>Choosing the right framework is critical. Here’s a practical comparison for developers familiar with the AI landscape.</p><ul><li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> With LangChain, a 'hello world' agent often requires understanding concepts like <code>Chains</code>, <code>Agents</code>, <code>Tools</code>, <code>Toolkits</code>, <code>Executors</code>, and specific prompt templates. AgentCraft streamlines this. You initialize an <code>LLM</code>, define <code>Tools</code>, and pass them to an <code>Agent</code>. The initial setup is demonstrably faster and requires learning fewer core concepts.</li><li><strong>Code Verbosity:</strong> Consider a simple task: giving an LLM a calculator tool. In LangChain, this involves importing multiple modules, defining the tool, initializing the LLM, and then wiring everything together with an <code>AgentExecutor</code>. In AgentCraft, the equivalent setup is more direct: <p><em>Conceptually:</em></p><pre><code class="language-python">agent = Agent(llm=OpenAI(), tools=[CalculatorTool()])
result = agent.run('What is 25 * 8?')</code></pre><p>This conciseness is a recurring theme, allowing you to maintain focus on the 'what' rather than the 'how'.</p></li><li><strong>Flexibility vs. Opinionation:</strong> LangChain provides an enormous ecosystem and countless ways to accomplish any given task, offering maximum flexibility. This can also lead to decision paralysis. AgentCraft is more opinionated, offering a clear, well-trodden path for common agentic patterns. It provides flexibility where it matters—in defining custom tools and agent logic—without overwhelming the developer with choices for every component.</li><li><strong>Use Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Choose AgentCraft when:</strong> You are building task-specific agents, need to prototype an idea quickly, value code clarity and maintainability, or are new to agent development.</li><li><strong>Choose LangChain when:</strong> You need to leverage its vast ecosystem of third-party integrations, are building extremely complex, multi-chain systems that require granular control over every step, or are working within a team that already has deep LangChain expertise.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="setting-up-your-agentcraft-development-environment">Setting Up Your AgentCraft Development Environment</h2><h3 id="prerequisites-for-building-your-agent">Prerequisites for Building Your Agent</h3><p>Before we start coding, let's ensure your environment is ready. You'll need three things:</p><ol><li><strong>Python 3.9+ installed:</strong> AgentCraft leverages modern Python features. You can check your version by running <code>python --version</code> in your terminal.</li><li><strong>Familiarity with using a terminal or command prompt:</strong> We will use it for creating a project directory, managing our virtual environment, and running the agent.</li><li><strong>An API key from an LLM provider:</strong> Agents need a powerful language model to act as their 'brain'. This guide will use OpenAI, but AgentCraft supports others like Anthropic, Groq, or Google Gemini. You will need to get an API key from your chosen provider's website.</li></ol><h3 id="installation-and-configuration-in-3-simple-steps">Installation and Configuration in 3 Simple Steps</h3><p>Let's get your project set up correctly. Using a virtual environment is a best practice to keep project dependencies isolated.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Create a project folder and set up a Python virtual environment.</strong></p><p>Open your terminal and run the following commands:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir agentcraft-researcher
cd agentcraft-researcher
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`</code></pre><p><strong>Step 2: Install AgentCraft and its dependencies.</strong></p><p>For our research agent, we'll need AgentCraft, a tool for web search (we'll use Tavily), a library to load environment variables, and OpenAI's library.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">pip install agentcraft openai python-dotenv tavily-python</code></pre><p><strong>Step 3: Securely configure your LLM API key.</strong></p><p>Never hardcode your API keys in your source code. We'll use an environment variable. Create a file named <code>.env</code> in your project folder:</p><pre><code class="language-text"># .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-api-key-here"</code></pre><p>Replace the placeholder text with your actual keys. Our Python script will securely load these keys.</p><h2 id="step-by-step-guide-building-a-simple-research-assistant-agent">Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Simple Research Assistant Agent</h2><h3 id="step-1-defining-the-agents-goal-and-tools">Step 1: Defining the Agent's Goal and Tools</h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Our goal is to build an autonomous agent that can perform research on a given topic. Specifically, when given a query, it should be able to search the web to find relevant, up-to-date information and then synthesize that information into a concise, easy-to-digest summary.</p><p><strong>Tools Required:</strong> An LLM by itself cannot access live information from the internet. It only knows about the data it was trained on. To overcome this limitation, we need to equip our agent with a tool. For this task, a web search tool is perfect. We will use the Tavily Search API, which is designed specifically for AI agents and provides clean, relevant search results.</p><h3 id="step-2-writing-the-core-agent-logic-with-agentcraft">Step 2: Writing the Core Agent Logic with AgentCraft</h3><p>Now for the exciting part. Create a file named <code>research_agent.py</code> in your project folder and add the following code. The comments explain each part of the process.</p><pre><code class="language-python">import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agentcraft import Agent, llms, tools

# --- Part 1: Load Environment Variables ---
# This line loads the API keys from your .env file.
load_dotenv()

# --- Part 2: Initialize the LLM and Tools ---

# Initialize the 'brain' of our agent. We're using OpenAI's GPT-4o model.
# AgentCraft's llms module provides convenient wrappers.
llm = llms.OpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

# Initialize the search tool. AgentCraft will automatically understand
# how to use this tool based on its description.
search_tool = tools.TavilySearchResults(max_results=5)

# --- Part 3: Create the Agent Instance ---

# Define a system message. This is a high-level instruction that guides
# the agent's behavior, personality, and goal.
system_message = """

Always cite your sources implicitly by summarizing the content you found.
"""

# Create the agent. We provide it with the LLM (its brain),
# a list of tools it can use, and the system message to guide it.
research_agent = Agent(
    llm=llm,
    tools=[search_tool],
    system_message=system_message
)

# --- Part 4: Define the Main Execution Block ---

def main():
    """ The main function to run our research agent. """
    print("Research Assistant Agent is ready. Type 'exit' to quit.")
    
    while True:
        user_query = input("> ")
        if user_query.lower() == 'exit':
            break

        # The .run() method is the entry point for the agent.
        # It takes the user's query and starts its reasoning process.
        response = research_agent.run(user_query)
        print(f"\nAssistant: {response}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</code></pre><h3 id="step-3-running-your-agent-and-understanding-the-output">Step 3: Running Your Agent and Understanding the Output</h3><p>With the code saved, it's time to run your agent. Open your terminal in the project directory (where <code>research_agent.py</code> and <code>.env</code> are located) and execute the script.</p><p><strong>Command to execute:</strong></p><pre><code class="language-bash">python research_agent.py</code></pre><p>You'll see the prompt <code>Research Assistant Agent is ready. Type 'exit' to quit.</code></p><p><strong>Example query:</strong></p><p>Now, let's give it a task. Type the following query and press Enter:</p><pre><code class="language-text">&gt; What is the current state of generative AI in healthcare?</code></pre><p><strong>Understanding the output:</strong></p><p>Behind the scenes, AgentCraft provides logging that shows the agent's thought process. A simplified version of its internal monologue might look like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Thought:</strong> The user is asking about the current state of generative AI in healthcare. I do not have real-time information. I need to use my web search tool to find recent articles and reports on this topic.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> Call <code>TavilySearchResults</code> with the query <code>generative AI in healthcare current state</code>.</li><li><strong>Observation:</strong> [The agent receives a list of search results, including snippets from articles about AI in drug discovery, diagnostic imaging, personalized treatment plans, and administrative automation.]</li><li><strong>Thought:</strong> I have gathered sufficient information from multiple sources. Now I will synthesize this information into a comprehensive summary, highlighting key areas like drug discovery, diagnostics, and patient care, as requested by my system prompt.</li></ul><p>Finally, the agent will print its polished, final answer to your console:</p><pre><code>Assistant: Generative AI is making significant inroads in healthcare, transforming several key areas. In drug discovery, it is used to design novel molecules and predict their properties, drastically shortening development timelines. For diagnostics, AI models are being trained to analyze medical images like X-rays and MRIs with high accuracy, often detecting diseases earlier than the human eye. Furthermore, generative AI is contributing to personalized medicine by creating tailored treatment plans based on a patient's genetic and lifestyle data. It is also streamlining administrative tasks by automating the generation of clinical notes and patient summaries, reducing physician burnout. The field is rapidly evolving, with ongoing research focused on ensuring model safety, accuracy, and ethical deployment.</code></pre><h2 id="expanding-your-agent-next-steps-and-further-learning">Expanding Your Agent: Next Steps and Further Learning</h2><h3 id="adding-custom-tools-and-capabilities">Adding Custom Tools and Capabilities</h3><p>The true power of agents comes from their ability to interact with any system or data source. AgentCraft makes it incredibly simple to create your own custom tools. A tool is just a Python function decorated with <code>@tools.tool</code>.</p><p>Let's say you want to give your agent the ability to read a local file. Here’s how you could define a <code>file_reader</code> tool:</p><pre><code class="language-python">from agentcraft import tools

@tools.tool
def read_local_file(file_path: str, lines_to_read: int = 10) -> str:
    """Reads the first few lines of a local text file.

    Args:
        file_path: The path to the file to read.
        lines_to_read: The number of lines to return from the start of the file.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            lines = [f.readline() for _ in range(lines_to_read)]
            return "".join(lines)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error reading file: {e}"

# To use it, simply add it to your agent's tool list:
# agent = Agent(llm=llm, tools=[search_tool, read_local_file])</code></pre><p>The agent's LLM will automatically understand the function's purpose from its name and docstring, and know what arguments it requires from the type hints. You can create tools to interact with your company's internal APIs, databases, or any other resource you can access with Python.</p><h3 id="exploring-more-complex-agentic-workflows">Exploring More Complex Agentic Workflows</h3><p>Our research assistant is a single agent performing a task. The next level is creating multi-agent systems where agents collaborate to achieve a more complex goal. Imagine a workflow where:</p><ol><li>A <strong>Researcher Agent</strong> (like the one we built) gathers raw information.</li><li>It passes this information to a <strong>Writer Agent</strong>, which specializes in transforming notes into a polished blog post.</li><li>Finally, a <strong>Critic Agent</strong> reviews the blog post for accuracy, clarity, and tone, providing feedback to the Writer Agent for revisions.</li></ol><p>AgentCraft's modular design is perfectly suited for these patterns. Because each agent has a simple <code>.run()</code> method, you can easily orchestrate these workflows in your code. The output of <code>researcher.run(topic)</code> can be used directly as part of the input for <code>writer.run(notes)</code>. This clear and composable structure makes building sophisticated, multi-agent systems a manageable and intuitive process.</p><h2 id="conclusion-start-building-smarter-with-agentcraft">Conclusion: Start Building Smarter with AgentCraft</h2><p>In this guide, we've journeyed from the concept of an AI agent to a fully functional research assistant.
